# CS465 Full Stack Development
Building a full stack application, specifically called the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js) stack.

# Project
Produce a fully functional travel web application for your client, Travlr Getaways, that meets software requirements.

# Architecture
Originally, the front end was developed using Express HTML. One of our objectives in this course was to convert the Express HTML to a .hbs view. The reasoning for this conversion is to increase rendering speeds, as pages would not have to fully load each time the website is refreshed. I used JavaScript language on both the front and back end, to pull trip information from the MongoDB database. A SPA (single page application) was developed so that only the information needed is delivered, while the browser renders it. The back end uses a NoSQL MongoDB database due to its ease of use in terms of modifications and scaling.

# Functionality
JSON and JavaScript tie together as JSON data can be easily read by JavaScript to form literal objects. By using JavaScript in both the front and back end of development, data can be stored once and used in many ways. Because I was  reusing UI components, I was able to efficiently refactor code with the trip card/trip listing components.

# Testing
CRUD Methods such as GET, Post, Put, and DELETE are http requests that are used to interact with a database. Endpoints for these methods requires testing so that a developer can confirm if they function as intended. Security is a layer that is added to prevent unauthorized users from having access to the database.

# Reflection
This course has really helped me get a better understanding of what it means to be a full stack developer. Although I am still unsure if I want to pursue being a full stack, back end, or front end developer, I have a better understanding of what each choice entails. I thoroughly enjoyed using many modules and components in this course to complete my project.
